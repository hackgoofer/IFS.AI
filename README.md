  <em> Embrace every part of you with through conversation. Inspired by Internal Family System Therapy </em>
</p>

## What is Internal Family System Therapy
IFS is a transformative tool that conceives of every human being as a system of protective and wounded inner parts led by a core Self. We believe the mind is naturally multiple and that is a good thing. Just like members of a family, inner parts are forced from their valuable states into extreme roles within us. Self is in everyone. It can’t be damaged. It knows how to heal.
